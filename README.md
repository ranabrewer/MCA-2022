# Week 1

The theme for my dataset is the musical 'The Phantom of the Opera' by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The musical premiered in 1986 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London and is based on the 1909 novel Le Fantôme de l'Opéra by French author Gaston Leroux. It went on to open on Broadway in New York City in 1988 and is currently the longest running show in Broadway history. However, it was announced on September 18th 2022 that the show's Broadway run would be coming to an end in February 2023. The plot takes place in the Palais Garnier (Paris Opera House) across the late 19th and early 20th centuries and follows the story of the up and coming soprano singer Christinne Daaé	who is sought after by the titular Phantom of the Opera house whilst herself falling for the Viscount Raoul de Chagny (whom reciprocates the feeling). I have selected this for my theme as I am interested in exploring the musical data available for musical theatre as well as being a fan of this musical. The tasks of Week 1 involve investigating the descriptive, notated and acoustic data available for The Phantom of the Opera and addressing any challenges that arise when working with musical data.

### Descriptive Data

Most of the descriptive data about this musical can be found on music streaming platforms such as TIDAL and Spotify. However, the descriptive data available is in some ways unique depending on the streaming platform used. Whilst both TIDAL and Spotify have the basic descriptive data such as title of the album, the individiual titles of songs, the specific cast on that recording, the year of release, the duration of song and suggests songs of a similar genre for listeners, [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/browse/album/619259) provides further descriptive data such as the names of all the members of the orchestra as well as the singers, those behind the mixing of the recording and also the lyrics to each song. Although [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3LfD2yRlfHAtTryX8rFp25?si=Oxml7-saTpOrEZW6Q0PrYg) does not provide as in depth a description of all aspects of the recordings, it instead analyses the listening habits of those who enjoy Phantom in order to tailor its services to be specific to each listener. For example, on the Spotify page for the original London cast recording there is a ranking of the top 5 most popular songs to help to introduce new listeners to the album, suggests artists that are of a simlar genre and links to playlists that feature songs from Phantom. The Phantom of the Opera does have a wesbite but it does not contain much useful information about the musical data. The website serves mainly as a place to buy tickets to see the show live which is encouraging individuals to expereince the acoustic data in the form of a live performance. The website does offer examples of analysis of the descriptive data it holds. Within its [privacy policy & cookies](https://uk.thephantomoftheopera.com/privacy-policy/) section, it states that it uses various stored data about customers to understand better the purchasing habits and website usage, so they can inform customers via newsletters about other musicals of a similar genre that would be suited to their tastes. 

### Notated Data

User WebbLi3b3 uploaded a collection of [Musical Theatre Sheet Music Scores](https://archive.org/details/musical-theatre-sheet-music/Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera%20Full%20Piano%20Vocal%20Score/) to Internet Archive which includes 3 versions of the full piano and vocal score for Phantom as well as a collection of piano highlights. However, it is hard to access full orchestra scores anywhere online but this is equally understandable as accessing full orchestra scores normally reqiures the purchasing of certain performance licenses. As well as Internet Archive , there are also a few uploads to MuseScore of songs from the musical. However, the sheet music available is dependent on the user knowing to search for Andrew Lloyd Webber as well as the musical's title. I discovered that when searching for ['The Phantom of the Opera'](https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=the%20phantom%20of%20the%20opera) on MuseScore, the majority of results were the titular song (with the exception of one upload of The Music of the Night) but when searching for [Andrew Lloyd Webber](https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=andrew%20lloyd%20webber) there were other versions of The Music of the Night.

### Acoustic Data

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=phantom+of+the+opera&and[]=mediatype%3A%22audio%22) also holds various recordings from many of the casts of Phantom across many years. As mentioned in the descriptive data section, there are a number of cast recordings from different years and countries across the music streaming servies as well as a selection of covers of some of the most popular songs from the musical by different artists. There is also an official YouTube channel for Phantom which has a mixture of content including clips from numerous live performances as well as the 2004 movie. However, there are very few full performances online besides some amateur university/high school renditions due to the tight restrictions around bootlegging any musical. 

# Week 2 

This week's task involved identifying a piece of music from our chosen dataset, downloading a PDF of said music and editing it in the music compositional software MuseScore. I decided to use one of the most popular and well known songs from The Phantom of the Opera - 'Think Of Me'. Below are screenshots of my transcription as well as a link to a [PDF](https://github.com/ranabrewer/MCA-2022/files/9923761/Think.of.Me.pdf) of it.

# Week 3

There were two tasks to be completed this week. The first task required generating both MusicXML and MEI files of the transcription that was created last week. 
The MusicXML file of 'Think Of Me' can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ranabrewer/MCA-2022/blob/master/Lab%20Tasks/Week%203/Think%20of%20Me.mei) and the MEI file of 'Think Of Me' can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ranabrewer/MCA-2022/blob/master/Lab%20Tasks/Week%203/Think%20of%20Me.mei). 

The second task required rendering the MEI file into verovio which can be viewed [here](https://ranabrewer.github.io/MCA-2022/verovio.html). A screenshot of the verovio rendering can also be seen below.

# Week 4

The tasks for this week involved creating a jSymbolic report for my encoded music and then using this information to generate both a piano roll and pitch histogram of 'Think Of Me' using the Python notebook.

# Week 5






























# Week 8 

For this week, we had to identify 3 music tracks relating to our theme that ideally differed in sound and style and list the most important technical and non-technical metadata associated with each track. This information has been listed below. I selected three songs from The Phanton of the Opera which although are still all operatic, they differ in sound and vocals.

| Track Title | Artist(s) | Composer | Copyright Info | Genre | Source | File/Audio format | Number of channels | Sample rate | Bits per second | Duration |
| ------------| --------  | -------- | -------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | -------- |

After selecting the tracks and identifying the features, we then had to generate a waveform and a spectogram of each of the songs via Sonic Visualiser.

### Prima Donna Waveform

### The Phantom of the Opera spectogram
![phantom 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114150400/203164374-980c3043-7c51-4ffe-b616-218e45e9b42a.png)

It is fair to say that both waveform and time-frequency analysis have their own benefits but there are certain advantages that the one can have over the other. Waveform analysis does allow for seeing the amplitude of the whole sample very clearly meaning that the distinction between dynamics is easy to see. In some instances this distinction in dynamics can translate to distinctions between musical passages which is also a benefit. However, there is not a lot else that waveform analysis can provide in such a clear manner. On the other hand, time-frequency analysis provides a clearer image of each distinct pitch and the timbre of each pitch which is something that waveform cannot as easily provide. Looking at The Phantom of the Opera's waveform, it is actually quite difficult to see any clear divide between passages because the dynamics stay generally the same within this sample m eaning there is little to be gained from the waveform analysis. However, looking at The Phantom of the Opera's spectogram, it is clear that this section of the song stays mainly within the lower register due to which which frequencies (and therefore which pitches) are lit. 

# Week 9

The tasks for this week involved selecting three tracks relating to our theme and generate Waveforms, Spectograms, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Chromagrams for each in Sonic Visualiser. I chose Think of Me (the track I focused on in the first few weeks) as well as The Music of the Night and All I Ask of You The Spectograms, MFCCs and Chromagrams were then to be exported in CSV files and generate histograms for each of these.

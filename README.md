# Rana's Final Project MCA
## Week 1

The theme for my dataset is the musical 'The Phantom of the Opera' by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The musical premiered in 1986 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London and was based on the 1909 novel Le Fantôme de l'Opéra by French author Gaston Leroux. It went on to open on Broadway in New York City in 1988 and is currently the longest running show in Broadway history. However, it was announced on September 18th 2022 that the show's Broadway run would be coming to an end in February 2023. The plot takes place in the Palais Garnier (Paris Opera House) across the late 19th and early 20th centuries and follows the story of the up and coming soprano singer Christinne Daaé	who is sought after by the titular Phantom of the Opera house whilst herself falling for the Viscount Raoul de Chagny (whom reciprocates the feeling). I have selected this for my theme as I am interested in exploring the musical data available for musical theatre as well as being a fan of this musical. The tasks of Week 1 involve investigating the descriptive, notated and acoustic data available for The Phantom of the Opera and addressing any challenges that arise when working with musical data.

### Descriptive Data

Most of the descriptive data about this musical can be found on music streaming platforms such as TIDAL and Spotify. However, the descriptive data available is in some ways unique depending on the streaming platform used. Whilst both TIDAL and Spotify have the basic descriptive data such as title of the album, the individiual titles of songs, the specific cast on that recording, the year of release, the duration of song and suggests songs of a similar genre for listeners, TIDAL provides further descriptive data such as the names of all the members of the orchestra as well as the singers, those behind the mixing of the recording and also the lyrics to each song. Although Spotify does not provide as in depth a description of all aspects of the recordings, it instead analyses the listening habits of those who enjoy Phantom in order to tailor its services to be specific to each listener. For example, on the Spotify page for the original London cast recording there is a ranking of the top 5 most popular songs to help to introduce new listeners to the album, suggests artists that are of a simlar genre and links to playlists that feature songs from Phantom. The Phantom of the Opera does have a wesbite but it does not contain much useful information about the musical data. The website serves mainly as a place to buy tickets to see the show live which is encouraging individuals to expereince the acoustic data in the form of a live performance.

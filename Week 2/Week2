<h1>Week 2: Notation</h1>
<p>This week's task involved identifying a piece of music from our chosen dataset, downloading a PDF of said music and editing it in the music compositional software MuseScore. I decided to use one of the most popular and well known songs from The Phantom of the Opera - 'Think Of Me'. </p>
